**Project Title:** AirBnB Clone - Console Application Using Python OOP

**Objectives:**

* **Gain Experience in Package Creation:** Learn how to structure and distribute Python code within a package for better organization and reusability.
* **Command Interpreter Development:** Master the `cmd` module to build a user-friendly text-based interface for interaction with the application.
* **Unit Testing Implementation:** Understand the concepts of unit testing and apply them to ensure code quality and maintainability in large projects.
* **Data Serialization:** Explore techniques for converting object data into a storable format like JSON and vice versa.
* **File Handling:** Practice reading from and writing to JSON files for data persistence.
* **Date and Time Management:** Learn how to effectively work with date and time values in Python using the `datetime` module.
* **Understanding UUIDs:** Grasp the purpose and usage of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for object identification.
* **Advanced Parameter Handling:** Demystify `*args` and `**kwargs` for handling variable-length argument lists and keyword arguments in functions.

**Project Context:**

This AirBnB clone project serves as the foundation for building a comprehensive web application using Python and relevant technologies. The initial phase focuses on constructing a robust console-based interface that interacts with the back-end logic managed by Python object-oriented programming (OOP).

**Interface Description:**

Imagine a streamlined version of the familiar Bash command line tailored specifically for AirBnB website interactions. This command interpreter facilitates communication between users and the back-end functionalities.

**Core Commands:**

* `show`: View details of an existing object (user, place, etc.).
* `create`: Add a new object to the system.
* `update`: Modify attributes of an existing object.
* `destroy`: Remove an object permanently.
* `count`: Get a tally of objects belonging to a specific category.

**Action Capabilities:**

Beyond command execution, the interplay between the interpreter, back-end logic, and file storage enables:

* Creating new instances of various objects (e.g., users, places).
* Retrieving object data from storage (file, database, etc.).
* Performing actions on objects (counting, data analysis, etc.).
* Updating object properties as needed.
* Deleting objects when appropriate.

By successfully completing this project, you'll acquire valuable skills in Python package creation, command line interface development, unit testing, data handling, and OOP principles, laying the groundwork for more advanced web application construction.
